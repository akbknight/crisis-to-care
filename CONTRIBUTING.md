# Contributing to Crisis to Care

We believe that the best way to support first-gen students is through a community-driven effort. Whether you're a developer, a writer, or a student with a story to share, your contribution is valuable!

## How You Can Help

### 1. Suggest Campus Resources
The "Campus Navigator" is only as good as the information it provides. If you know of a great resource at your university (counseling centers, food pantries, first-gen groups), let us know!
- Open an issue with the title `[Resource]: Resource Name - University Name`.
- Provide a brief description and a link to the resource's website.

### 2. Share Your Story
We want the "Community" section to feel alive and authentic. If you're a first-gen student and want to share an anonymous tip, a success story, or a struggle you've overcome:
- We're working on a formal submission form, but for now, you can suggest story ideas via issues or pull requests.

### 3. Improve the Code
If you're a student developer:
- **UI/UX:** Help us make the app even more accessible and welcoming.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the app works perfectly for everyone using screen readers or other assistive technologies.
- **Bug Fixes:** See a typo or a broken link? A small PR is a huge help!

## Technical Setup

Please refer to the [README.md](README.md) for local setup instructions.

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Create a branch** for your feature or fix.
3. **Submit a Pull Request** with a clear description of what you've changed and why.
