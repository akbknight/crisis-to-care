# Crisis to Care

**Empowering first-generation college students to navigate university life with confidence and support.**

Crisis to Care is a mission-driven web application designed specifically for first-generation students on large university campuses. It provides a safe, anonymous space to connect with peers, find essential campus resources, and handle moments of crisis with grounding and support.

## 🌟 Why This Exists

First-gen students often face unique challenges: navigating complex administrative systems, balancing work/family with academics, and dealing with a sense of isolation in large institutional environments. This project aims to bridge that gap by providing a central hub for support that understands the first-gen experience.

## 🚀 Features

-   **Anonymous Community:** A place to share stories and connect with other first-gen students without the pressure of identity.
-   **Campus Navigator:** Step-by-step guidance to find the right office or resource on your specific campus.
-   **Crisis Support:** Immediate grounding exercises and a clear path to professional help when things get overwhelming.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project is built using modern web development tools:

-   **React:** For a dynamic and responsive UI.
-   **Vite:** For fast development and building.
-   **Tailwind CSS:** For a clean, modern aesthetic.
-   **Framer Motion:** For smooth animations and transitions.
-   **Lucide React:** For beautiful, consistent iconography.
